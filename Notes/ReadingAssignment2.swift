 Type Aliases
 Type aliases define an alternative name for an existing type.
 refer to an existing type by a name that is descriptive
 typealias AudioSample = UInt16
 var maxAmplitudeFound = AudioSample.min
 Because it is an alias, the call to AudioSample.minactually calls UInt16.min

 Numeric Literals
 Represent numbers in different ways (1.25e2, binary, hexidec, etc)
 Numbers can contain extra formatting to make them easier to read
 padded with extra zeros and underscores for readability
 let paddedDouble = 000123.456
 let oneMillion = 1_000_000
 let justOverOneMillion = 1_000_000.000_000_1
 
 Converting number types
 Float/Double to Integer
 Int is simply truncated
 4.75 becomes 4, and -3.9 becomes -3
 Int(Double.pi)  // 3
